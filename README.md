# Shift-Scheduler

An algorithm that computes the best possible shift assignments with a heuristic that optimizes for assigning everyone similar numbers of shifts while prioritizing the shifts people get assigned to by how unique the shift is related to everyone elseâ€™s availability. I wrote this for automatically assigning tours of Cal Poly's College of Engineering to our CENG Ambassadors based on their availability each quarter.
